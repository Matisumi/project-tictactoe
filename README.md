Repo for THP's tictactoe ex


## Pair learning Sabine et Fabien ...

**What these programs does ?**


 1. "This Tic tac toe game is played in the Terminal and is entirely coded in Ruby."
  
  - When you launch the game, you are asked to prompt the names of the players.

  - Then you are asked to choose a case to play.

  - If this case is already taken, you will be asked to play again, and a list of the remaining able cases will be print.

  - Enjoy the game !!




## If it doesn't work ... for some reason

**Please don't be a screwdriver ... give me a call**
